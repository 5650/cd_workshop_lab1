# cd_workshop_lab1
Lab1 of the Continuous Delivery Workshop

The intent of this lab is to create website in a docker image and then upload that image to a local docker registry. This is meant to work within the VPC context created by the https://github.com/RoundTower-io/cd_workshop_environment terraform repo.
